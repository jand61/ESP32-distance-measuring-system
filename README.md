# ESP32-distance-measuring-system
This project contains of an ESP32 microcontroller, an ultrasonic Sensor(HC-SC04) and four LEDs with protective 220Ohm resistors each. The whole project is connected to a small 400-pin breadboard, to get better adaptability for possible changes in the future.  The idea behind this project was to gage the distance to the nearest object in range, transmit the measured value to an Android App called "Blynk" via WiFi and turn on one out of four LEDs depending on the distance determined by the sensor. In addition to that the color of the currently flashing LED is shown in the app, too. I used the Arduino IDE to write the code, which is shown below
